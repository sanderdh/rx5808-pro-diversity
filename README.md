#Introduction
This project originated [here](https://code.google.com/p/rx5808-pro/) and has been modified to include diversity receiver menu.

The main goal of this fork was to add diversity to an already amazing feature set. Please see the following video for a quick intro of the project.

[![Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/NwnQCUikqvI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwnQCUikqvI)

The code is also now backward compatible with the original rx5808-pro schematic minus diversity and dip switch mode. For details on updating click [here](/docs/diy-arduino-nano.md).

####In the works...
- Auto switch video from GUI to Receiver on button pressed
- New board design taking heat concerns into account.
- Breakout rx5808 functionality into its own library.

##Usage
####Screens

1. **Mode Select** - Use the up/down buttons to navigate. Hit mode to select. Don't press anything to return to the last mode selected. ![GUI Screen](docs/img/screen-menu.jpg "Mode Select")

2. **Auto Scan** - Scans all bands until a signal with good signal strength is found. ![GUI Screen](docs/img/screen-auto-scan.jpg "Auto Scan")

4. **Band Scaner** - Scans all bands and presents them with a sitnal strength bar graph. ![GUI Screen](docs/img/screen-band-scan.jpg "Band Scaner")

3. **Manual Mode** - Will hold on a manualy selected channel. ![GUI Screen](docs/img/screen-manual.jpg "Manual Mode")

5. **Diversity** - Select which receiver to use or auto. Also Displays signal strength of each antenna. ![GUI Screen](docs/img/screen-diversity.jpg "Diversity")

6. **Save** - Saves last used channel and mode for next power cycle. This is also where you enter RSSI calibration mode. ![GUI Screen](docs/img/screen-save.jpg "Save")

####Initial Setup
When powering on for the first time it is best to calibrate your RSSI. To do this follow these steps below. (You can repeat this process as many times as needed for best results.)

1. Power on your receiver and transmitter and place them about 10 to 20 feet apart from one another. (If you are using directional antennas make sure they are pointed at your transmitter for best results.)
2. next navigate to the "Save Setup" menu.
3. Wait for 1 second then hold Mode button for 3 seconds.
4. when you release the mode button you will enter RSSI calibration screen. This will scan all channels 10 times getting the min and max RSSI strength.
5. Once all 10 scans are complete you will be returned to the last home screen. You should now be able to have accurate RSSI readings and also auto scan to active channels.

##Hardware
This project is centered around the rx5808 5.8ghz receiver module which can be found at a number of online stores.

I have modified the original schematics to incorporate the diversity setup.

I have also added LEDs to represent which antenna is currently being selected.

##Software
The major software changes are centered around the diversity menu. This required removing the dip switch mode from the origional project. Within the diversity menu you will find RSSI signal strength for each receiver and the ability to select which mode the receivers are operating in (Auto, Receiver A, Receiver B).

The following values control how often we switch receiver in diversity auto mode.

```
// rssi strenth should be 2% greater than other receiver before switch.
// this pervents flicker when rssi values are close and delays diversity checks counter.
#define DIVERSITY_CUTOVER 2

// number of checks a receiver needs to win over the other to switch receivers.
// this pervents rapid switching.
// 1 to 10 is a good range. 1 being fast switching, 10 being slow 100ms to switch.
#define DIVERSITY_MAX_CHECKS 5
```

The diversity switching logic is simple.
```
If Receiver A is greater than Receiver B by two percent
  check_counter-- // receiverA win
else
  check_counter++ // receiverB win

If check_counter is zero
    Set receiverA as active receiver.
If check_counter is DIVERSITY_MAX_CHECKS
    Set receiverB as active receiver.
```



The two percent helps prevent rapid video switching when both RSSI are close in value.
